# Open Related URL - An Obsidian Plugin

An obsidian plugin. On any given note, you can use this to open urls that are mentioned in the note's YAML front matter.

## Use Cases

Obsidian is great for notes, and I often need to correlate my notes with a task list or a set of files. If you follow Tiago Forte's [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) method, he recommends you have a similar folder structure across all of your systems.

For me, the two most useful things to correlate are tasks and files. If you supply a `tasksUrl` that perhaps points to Asana or Clickup, you can open the correlating URL in seconds. This is also true if you supply a `filesUrl` that may point to a Google Drive or Dropbox folder.
